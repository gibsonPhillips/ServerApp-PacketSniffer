CS 3516 Project 2 Wireview
Authors: Gibson Phillips and Seth Frank
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This application parses pcap files - NO LIVE NETWORK SNIFFING OCCURS. 

There are two main items in the zip. "wireview.cpp" and "makefile".
The makefile will allow you to compile the app with the "make command, which will compile it to a program "wireview"

Wireview takes in 1 argument which is a capture of packets. We have included the 4 excample pcap files, and you should be able to use your own as well.

Please make sure that everything is in the same directory as you run the commands. 

An example for how to run would be 
$  ./wireview project2-http.pcap
